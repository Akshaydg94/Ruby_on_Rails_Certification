  This course was first offered in 2015 and I took it in June of 2016.
  My taking of this course was to get the "Bigger" picture from a certified professors point of view. 
  I acquired a lot of tips and knowledge in this evolving web development technology.

  Two days ago, (June 30 2016), Rails 5.0.0 was released and I'm still trying it, although
  it doesn't seem to be much different from the 5.0.0 beta4 released in May 2016.
